IMPORTANT NOTE
----------------------
My (Reid's) hard drive failed over the break, so it'll seem like I haven't done any new work for the MVP. I'm pair programming with Shureed, Meera and Arif as well as working on the front-end/doing research into the problems we're having (getting geolocation, doing unit tests, etc).
