GeoChat
============

IMPORTANT NOTE
----------------------
My (Reid's) hard drive failed over the break, so it'll seem like I haven't done any new work for the MVP. I'm pair programming with Shureed, Meera and Arif as well as working on the front-end/doing research into the problems we're having (getting geolocation, doing unit tests, etc).

What?
-------------------------
* Location-based chatroom
* Find out what's going on around you
* Meet people, make friends
* Post as yourself, or anonymously

Technology
------------
* Framework: Django with Twisted application
* Languages: Python, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript/JQuery
* Platform: Web, Mobile (Cordova/Phonegap)(Hopefully, may not get to)
* Database: mySQL
* Process tool: [Trello](http://www.trello.com)

How To Use 
========== 
* You will initially be directed to the login page, if you don't have an account follow the link to the registration page 
* After logging in you'll arrive at the chat page, where you can see the messages from everyone around you 
* At this point you can post and chat with the other users!
